### In the code I am using __name__ == "__main__" to call function bmi_calculation().

### I used bmi.json as an json example. We can replace it with any required json file.

### The table1 that I am using is mentioned below:

Table1 - BMI Category and the Health Risk.

BMI Category        BMI Range(kg/m2)      Health risk
Underweight           18.4 and below    Malnutrition risk
Normal weight         18.5 - 24.9           Low risk
Overweight            25 - 29.9           Enhanced risk
Moderately obese      30 - 34.9             Medium risk
Severely obese        35 - 39.9             High risk
Very severely obese   40 and above          Very high

### Please run test.py in any editor for the result.
