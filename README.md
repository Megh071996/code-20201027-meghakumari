### In the code I am using __name__ == "__main__" to call function bmi_calculation().

### I used bmi.json as an json example. We can replace it with any required json file.

### The table1 that I am using is mentioned below:



Table1 - BMI Category and the Health Risk.

|BMI Category       | BMI Range(kg/m2) |    Health risk     |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|
|Underweight        |   18.4 and below |   Malnutrition risk|
|Normal weight      |   18.5 - 24.9    |       Low risk     |
|Overweight         |   25 - 29.9      |     Enhanced risk  |
|Moderately obese   |   30 - 34.9      |       Medium risk  |
|Severely obese     |   35 - 39.9      |       High risk    |
|Very severely obese|   40 and above   |       Very high    |

### Please run test.py in any editor for the result.
